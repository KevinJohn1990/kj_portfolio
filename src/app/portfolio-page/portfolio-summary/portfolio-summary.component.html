      Full stack software developer with 9 years of experience.
    </span>
    I am an organized and hard-working individual, a team player with good
    communication and inter-personal skills. During the last 9 years of my
    career, I have gained experience in various technologies by developing
    desktop and web applications. While doing the same I have also gained
    experience in database languages like Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server,
    client-side frameworks like Angular, Ionic for developing SPA (Single Page
    Applications) and PWA (Progressive Web applications). I like investing my
    free time in improving my skill sets by learning new technologies. I have 6
    years of working experience in UAE and am looking forward to using my skills
    in an organization where I can continue to grow as well as help the
    organization achieve its goals.
